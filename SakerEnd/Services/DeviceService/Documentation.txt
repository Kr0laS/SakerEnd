A bit of documentaion: 

this server acts as a middle man between the client and the devices. 

when a user wants to start interacting with devices, he is going to send http req to this api, this http req will translate to a
configuration => subscription => status report => response to the user of the status report in the http requst.
after this proccess the device is going to send all sorts of devices status reports to the user, my program will send him to the signalR hub which will
Real-Time notify the front end about the new reports.
